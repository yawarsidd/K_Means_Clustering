# K_Means_Clustering
The dataset is a telecommunication dataset which contains categorical as well as continuous columns.The methodolgy adopted as:-
1. Importing the dataset
2. Missing values imputation, outliers Capping, Visualization, etc.
3. Feature Selection using Principal Component analysis (PCA)
4. Finding the optimal value of K using Elbow Ananlysis and Silhoutte Score.
5. Use K means clustering algorithm for the optimal value of K to find different clusters.
6. After trained the k-means model on the training dataset, the test dataset is used to predict the cluster labels.
